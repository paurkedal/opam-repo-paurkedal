description: """
Caqti is an library providing a common API to SQL databases and similar data
interfaces.  The assumption is that the data service is queried by passing a
string along with typed parameters, and responds with a sequence of typed
tuples.
Caqti may be used directly or to provide multi-database support to
higher-level solutions, like code generators and syntax extensions."""
